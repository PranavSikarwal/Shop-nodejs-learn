PUG layout feature:-

As we made redundancy by re-writing header details from files to files, we can improve this type of code using pug layout feature which allows us to set a basic layout and use it in other files

We can create a basic layout and add different data depending upon the changing content from one page to other.

made a new folder in views named as layouts where all basic layouts will be made.
made a main-layout.pug in layouts folder where we will write basic layout of page and extend it in every other page.

we used block <name-of-block> feature 
i.e. in main-layout file we wrote : -block style, -block content

and in other files we extended main-layout by:
i.e. in shop.pug -extends layouts/main-layout.pug
                 - block style
                    ....added required styles here
                 -block content
                    ....added content of shop here

i.e. in add-product.pug -extends layouts/main-layout.pug
                 - block style
                    ....added required styles here
                 -block content
                    ....added content of add-product here

similarly to page-not-found.pug

But if you have noticed we cannot add active property that was present for add product and shop pages at different times.
